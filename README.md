ðŸŽ¯ Day 2 of the 6-Day Advanced AI Training Program 

 Project: Real-Time Face Landmark Detection

I successfully developed a real-time face landmark detection system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

This project captures live video through the webcam and detects facial landmarks with high precision using MediaPipe's FaceMesh model. It supports tracking up to five faces simultaneously and overlays facial mesh data on live frames, offering a practical introduction to AI-powered computer vision applications.

ðŸ’¡Key Highlights:
- Implemented real-time facial landmark tracking
- Utilized OpenCV for video processing
- Integrated MediaPipe's FaceMesh solution
- Gained hands-on experience in computer vision and AI

Technologies used:
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- FaceMesh
